# Awesome Zanzibar [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Zanzibar is a fine-grained authorization (FGA) system, originally proposed [by Google in a research paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/#introduction). It allows for the definition of a complex access control policy, in which permissions are defined in terms of resources, actions and conditions. The main goal of Zanzibar-based services is to provide a flexible authorization system that can be used from simple web applications to complex distributed systems.
